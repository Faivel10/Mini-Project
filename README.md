# Mini-Project
Mini Project in stochastic optimization.
## How To Run
To run the project, you first need to have the following packages installed
```bash
build-essential
python3
pip
xlrd - can be installed using pip
```
After installing the required packages, just run:
```bash
./run.sh
```
## How It Works:
* reader.py file is responsible to read the xlxs input file and parse the points from it to a text file.
* After that that, main.cpp takes the parsed file, and does all the calculations.
